# Racers Ridge

## Description
Racers Ridge is a 3D arcade racing game, your goal is to beat the other racers and take home the victory! Racers Ridge was developed as a part of Arcade Abyss, a team project which I helped manage and create. 
Arcade Abyss was a collaborative project within my university course, the goal of Arcade Abyss is to collect each arcade machines trophy and unlock new machines in the progress of doing so. 

I was one of five managers who steered the game direction, as a manager I monitored a team of ten students and their current progress ensuring deadlines were met, in the later stages of the project, 
I helped intergrate students projects into the arcade and fix any issues that arose while playtesting.

Racers Ridge features a detailed map, leaderboards system, and AI racers.
